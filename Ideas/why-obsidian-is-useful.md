- spaced rep through review of and linking notes
- one place for all notes
- concepts come first, not sources
- editing notes to become *better over time*
- no context switching overhead - i can easily study many things at once and trust that i can come back to my notes later

Cons:
- what if i forget about a note? e.g. this one
