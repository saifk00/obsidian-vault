Write up a little philosophical treatise on how to manage several reading backlogs. Points to discuss
- Where do topics come from
- How do we categorize topics
- Prioritizing topics - is it useful?
	- Interest is variable - the 'value' we get from looking into X depends on our mood
	- Some things take longer to look into (e.g. 1 wiki article vs several papers)
- spaced repetition - maybe having to search for existing notes is valuable - recalling keywords and putting them into search might be part of learning
- Different types of tasks you need to do - the actual reading, writing, refinement, connection - create an N step model of how knowledge gets refined, maybe do some reading on this
- Meta: tasks like the one in this document are extra valuable because they increase the value of future tasks...

	- "Makes you *feel* productive"
		- So that means we need some way to actually *know* if we're productive - how?
	- I am *definitely* doing better work now that I use Obsidian - which is different from his experience
		- I feel like im taking actual notes now. And i can remember stuff i took in better
	- I literally did feel a *click* that he mentions doesn't exist
	- "Collectors fallacy"
		- "Only actually *producing* something from collected info is valuable"
			- I disagree, there is value in absorbing info in and of itself - it is ennobling
	- For example, normally I would have accepted this video and ditched pkm completely. But by taking notes in obsidian with the goal of writing this essay, I am actually critically engaging with the ideas - this is an idea from [[liedman-2018]]. 
	- "Analogy: optimal lifting routine is secondary to actually lifting/eating well". "PKM is not work, but an aid"
		- Maybe the thing here is to actually think about *what matters to you* - what outcomes you are actually trying to achieve.
	- "Trust your first brain"
		- Not everything is lost if not noted down. I agree.
	- "You dont need as much structure as you think"
		- Searching is pretty much sufficient for organization. Links are only necessary insofar as they spark new ideas... Hmm.. ok
	- "If you find your output is lower then the system is not working"
