Here i will list goals, as it is common advice to make long term goals and break them into short term ones. note that it is also common advice that planning is always provisional - unexpected things are expected. but just the very act of planning has value in itself.


# Long Term
- speak japanese fluently
- become part of a Khronos standards committee
- work on something aerospace related
- publish a paper
- be fit

# Short Term
