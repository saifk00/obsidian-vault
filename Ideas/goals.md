Here i will list goals, as it is common advice to make long term goals and break them into short term ones. note that it is also common advice that planning is always provisional - unexpected things are expected. but just the very act of planning has value in itself.

- publish a paper

# Medium Term (< Year, but more than a few months)

# Short Term (up to a few months)
