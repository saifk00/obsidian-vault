# Experiment
I'm going to start doing a 48h refeed on weekends to see if it helps on the cut. On 2023-10-01 I weighed 161.4 lbs, and I am down to 152.2 as of 2023-11-11 (a period of 41 days), which amounts to about 1.5lbs/wk. During this period, I was working out 6 days a week. Currently, I am feeling extremely tired and have even fallen sick, and have also noticed my lifting performance go down. My muscles are also noticeably less full.

The idea behind the refeed day is to refill the muscle glycogen stores required to both visually fill them up and also restore my lift performance. I am not really having trouble sitting at 1800kcal/day so the main other benefit is that I hope it will just generally lift my energy level and mood.
