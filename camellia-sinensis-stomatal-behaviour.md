- 'stomatal conductance' is a measure of the 'flux' that stoma produces over the surface area of a leaf. It is the rate at which CO2 enters and water leaves (no pun intended) per unit area
	- The stomatal conductance of sinensis is only proportional to the 'incident irradiance' (ie the amount of sunlight) EXCEPT during the dry season, in which case it is also tied to the rate of photosynthesis
- I would assume that photosynthesis is tied to incident irradiance, but apparently they are independent
- Transpiration from stoma also works to _cool down_ the plant! (not just to provide inputs and dump outputs of photosynthesis!) 
	- As it turns out, _most_ of the water uptake of a plant is lost to transpiration (wikipedia says 97-99.5%)
