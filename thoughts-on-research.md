As i stepped into the shower at the gym the thought suddenly struck me - i am 24 and the time is ticking on my desire to go back to school. But then I thought more deeply about the subject and here are some of my notes.

Why do i want to 'do research' and what does that even mean?

enjoying the 'philosophical mode of thinking' (call that PMT), i want to refine that skill

It seems that this mode of thinking isnt much appreciated in industry. For example my experience with this push for AI tools - no one is really philosophizing about what these things really are and what theyre capable of (todo - then what are the discussions really about?)

I want to get better at writing. reading stephen jay gould has furthered this desire
 
I want to make some great leap of insight from two disparate disciplines that i am deeply interested in. But why? just to feed my ego?

I enjoy trying to think outside the box and against the grain. (todo - examples?)

Do just like the 'idea' of doing research? if i like the idea so much then why dont i actually go out and read research papers? maybe im just a dilettante who likes reading pop science (re - my latest obsession with stephen jay gould).

I also like digging deep and asking tough questions of myself. critical critique

Is what i think of as 'philosophical mode of thinking' just dialectics? analytic vs. continental philosophy

Brainstorming is about reducing the friction of adding new ideas. 

I want to find evidence of someone using the PMT to actually do something useful at work. particularly i want to see creative design docs that draw on analogies to other disciplines
- This doesnt seem possible at the 'application level'
	- TODO - refine this dichotomy that i have in my head about app level vs platform level stuff - is that even a real thing? what do i really mean by it?
