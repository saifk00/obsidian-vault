Thinking of the classical veil of perception problem, you might imagine yourself one one side, and a 'thing in itself' on the other, with stuff coming out of the object and into your consciousness via sensory perception. But this visualization _presupposes the existence of space_, which is the thing in question!

Kant addresses this with some careful wording. There is "internal" and "external" perception. The former has temporality as its structural basis, while the latter is formed by space. In simple terms, my thoughts appear to me in temporal order, while what we normally think of as extended objects appear ordered in space (here is my body, there is the chair).
