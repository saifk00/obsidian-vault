One shortcoming of analytical philosophy is that it looks upon its subject of study from 'up on high,' that is - _objectively_ (without the superior connotations of the word). This is similar to what Marx said about the flaw in Feuerbach's materialism in his Theses on Feuerbach; that it seeks to understand the 'essence of man' as some eternal concept rather than in its social and historical reality.
