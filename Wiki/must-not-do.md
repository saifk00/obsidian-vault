These are various ways to say that you "must not" do something in japanese.

**てはいけません**
- This is the most formal phrase
- ***Example***: "武器に頼ってはいけません" (you must not rely on weapons)

**てはいけない**
- This is one step down in formality, by shortening いけません to いけない

By shortening the ”ては” we get the even less formal phrase(s):
**ちゃいけない** and **じゃいけない**
- ちゃ is used when the [[te-form]] of the preceding verb ends in て
	- ***Example***: "入れちゃいけない" (must not enter)
		- The te-form of 入れる is 入れて
- じゃ is used when the te-form of the preceding verb ends in で
	- ***Example***: "死んじゃいけない" (must not die)

By saying だめ instead of いけない we get the least formal:
**じゃだめ**
