`Vmasu に Verb{motion}`
私はデパトへ贈り物お買いに行った
- I went to the department store to buy a gift
- This form can only be used when the second verb *express* motion
	- 行く、来る、帰る、入る、出る
	- e.g. 歩く does *not* work because it *describes* a motion rather than *expressing* it
- Can sometimes drop the し if Vmasu is a [[suru-verb]]

`{Verb, Noun+の, Adj} ために [phrase]`
私は子供の写真お撮るためにカメラお買いった
- I bought a camera to take pictures of my child
- Differences with `Vmasu に`
	- This one can be used with *any* verb or clause in the second position (in the example, 買う)
	- This one requires a fully formed clause, whereas `Vmasu に` can leave out a direction to imply 'somewhere': 僕は酒お飲みに行った (i went to drink {somewhere})
	- ために with a verb of motion usually implies that the purpose was fairly important. You wouldn't say 酒お飲むために。。。
