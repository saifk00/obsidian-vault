This is example 3.8 in [[koller-2009]].

There are four students, A B C and D who study in pairs. All pairs study together except {A, C] and {B, D}. One day, the professor misspeaks in class giving rise to a misconception. Each student may have later realized the problem and thus resolved the misconception. When they study in pairs, they transmit this newfound understanding with some probability.

$x^1$ denotes that the student *has* the misconception, while $x^0$ denotes that they do not.

Intuitively, since A and C never speak to eachother, $(A \perp C \vert \{B, D\})$
