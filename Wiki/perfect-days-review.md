Draft of a perfect days review to be edited upon the 3rd watch
July 26, 2024


Perfect days is not a perfect movie. Rather, like its protagonist, it is so blindingly earnest that it baffled my conceited mind when I first watched it many moons ago. I applied all my vain analytical patterns to elicit the 'secret meaning' of the film : the hidden pain of the divorcee, the subterranean loneliness of the drifter, perhaps the sad acceptance of a life of labor. Again and again my mind would twist this way and that to avoid recognizing what was on the screen - a protagonist who was, in the words of critic Bilge Ebiri, "*that most elusive of figures: a contented and peaceable human being*". In other words, a man who had very simply *learned how to live*.

Only upon reflection, and an attempt to live like hirayama himself, have I realised that despite our pathologizing inclination, that temptation to psychologize behaviour outside our own experience, hirayama's approach to life is simply the only path to contentment. But this approach has far more depth to it than suggested by the superficial terms I often see surrounding discussions of this movie. (examples). Make no mistake: these platitudes belie a deep unease with accepting hirayamas lifestyle. When the mind encounters something unknown, it seeks to give it a warm label, thereby gaining control of it. (analogy) Hirayama doesnt just 'pay attention to the little things', he becomes them. He *is* the 木漏れ日, the tree filtering through the leaves. He *is* the ...

- hirayama is an instrument
- to serve, and to observe. These two words contain the sum of wisdom presented in Perfect days.

I have, to the greatest extent possible, abandoned all the noise and electronic detritus that so easily and invisibly pervades this 21st century life.

In this way, Perfect Days is the movie I have been searching for all my life; the one that can answer rather than ask, through art, the question of how to live.

Who cares if hirayama cleans the toilets? I ask myself - who cares if I write this review? The answer is the same; no one in particular. It is nothing more and nothing less than an offering to the world, one instrument to another, sun to the leaf, shade to the sapling, dust to dust.
