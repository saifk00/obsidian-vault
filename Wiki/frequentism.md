Frequentism is one possible interpretation of probability in the [[philosophy-of-probability]]. Loosely, it identifies probability with 'relative frequency' of occurrences.

# Actual Frequentism
Counting among its adherents John Venn himself, actual frequentism associates the probability of an event A in a reference class B as the relative frequency of occurrences of A within B.

# Hypothetical Frequentism
In hypothetical frequentism, we consider the hypothetical long-run of trials. That is, the probability is the value that the ratio of occurrences would converge to in an infinite sequence of trials.
