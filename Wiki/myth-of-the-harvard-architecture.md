The paper "The Myth of the Harvard Architecture"

> This terminology might be sloppy, but what relevance does it have to the formal history of computing? It has encouraged a myth that Aiken invented an architecture superior to that commonly attributed to von Neumann, but that this superiority was not recognised until many decades later

Unlike the [[von-neumann-architecture]], which is attributed to [[von-neumann]] because of the draft he wrote on the EDVAC, "No definition of the ‘Harvard architecture’ provides an equivalent basis to the First Draft for designing a computer."

The only relevance to modern computer architecture is the fact that some CPUs *cache* instructions and data (both from memory) separately or together.
