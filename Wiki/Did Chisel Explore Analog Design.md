## Question
Did Izraelevitz/Chisel folks explore the problem of analog design? What lessons from their digital hardware design approach might apply to analog EDA?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[hardware-compilers]] - References Izraelevitz-2019 Ch.4
- [[CIRCT]] - Digital hardware compilation infrastructure based on LLVM/MLIR
- [[chisel]] - Scala-based hardware design language
- Need to research: Chisel ecosystem's analog capabilities, if any

## Initial Investigation
*[Research findings will be added here as investigation progresses]*

## Further Questions
- What aspects of Chisel's design philosophy could apply to analog?
- How does Chisel handle mixed-signal design, if at all?
- What can we learn from their approach to hardware abstraction?
- Could FIRRTL-style intermediate representations work for analog circuits?
