The guiding questions
- how is the layout problem formalized in the literature?
- Has anyone applied the principle of stationary action to come up with a smooth differentiable function for layout in the phase space that incorporates constraints?
- What are the standard techniques to the general layout problem?

- "It starts from an unannotated netlist, performs automatic layout constraint extraction and device generation, then performs placement and post-placement optimization, followed by routing to obtain the final GDSII layout."
- Input: circuit netlist + design rules
- Modules:
	- Constraint extraction
	- Parameterized device generator
	- Analog placer + post-placement optimization
	- Analog router

## History
As always, history is our guiding star.

Early endeavors for automated IC layout:
- Simulated annealing
