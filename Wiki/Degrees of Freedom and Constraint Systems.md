# Degrees of Freedom and Constraint Systems

## Rigid Body Approximation

> "the principle of degrees of freedom let us assume that rigid bodies may be specified by a single atom - it assumes the distances between atoms are fixed"

The rigid body constraint **fixes all inter-atomic distances**, reducing the system's degrees of freedom dramatically. This makes the mathematics tractable but limits physical realism.

## Non-Rigid Body Simulation Strategy

> "This helps me understand how we might simulate non-rigid bodies; approximate them as equidistanct points whose distances are only constrained to neighbouring points"

**Key insight:** Instead of constraining ALL distances (rigid), constrain only NEIGHBORING distances (deformable).

### Constraint Comparison

| System Type | Distance Constraints | Degrees of Freedom | Physical Behavior |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Rigid Body | All inter-atomic distances fixed | 6 (3 translation + 3 rotation) | No deformation |
| Soft Body | Only neighboring distances constrained | 3N (N = number of particles) | Local deformation allowed |

## Computational Implementation

This constraint relaxation suggests a natural simulation approach:
- Model objects as particle systems
- Apply spring-like forces between neighboring particles
- Allow global shape changes while maintaining local structure

## Connection to Classical Mechanics

This bridges the gap between:
- **Theoretical:** Configuration spaces and generalized coordinates
- **Computational:** Particle-based physics simulation
- **Practical:** Real-time deformable body animation
