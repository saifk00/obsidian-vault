# い-Adjectives
Also known as "I-adjectives," these adjectives directly describe nouns. The name comes from the fact that all い-adjectives have a **stem form** that ends with い. The ending of I-adjectives can be *modified* to express things like **tense** or **truth** value.

According to [[kaiser-2013]] (Chapter 6), i-adjectives are "adjectives proper". The history here is that i-adjectives are the original, native Japanese adjectives, while na-adjectives came later. That is why i-adjectives tend to express more fundamental, primal concepts like colors, emotions, sizes, etc.
## Examples
- 安い
- 可愛い
- 高い
## Conjugations
### Expressing Truth
In the stem form, the i-adjective is *true*. To *negate* it, add the `~くない` ending.
### Expressing Tense
Recall that [[japanese-has-only-two-tenses]]. To make an i-adjective past tense, use the `~かった` ending. This stacks on top of the truth value ending, so to say something 'was not cheap' would be `
`高くなかった`.
## Position in a Sentence
### End of Sentence
When at the end of a sentence, the i-adjective acts as the [[predicate]] of the sentence. For example, ”お母さんの料理はおいしい” (mother's cooking is delicious). Here, the i-adjective is ”おいしい”.
### Before a Noun
By placing a (conjugated) i-adjective before a noun, we modify the noun and create a new noun. For example, 古い車 (old car) can be used just like a noun.


## 〜しい Adjectives
Many i-adjectives end in しい, like 楽しい and 悲しい - these represent the speaker's subjective emotion. They *cannot* be used to describe someone else's emotions - for that, there are sometimes related adjectives that can be used for that purpose. If not, you can use [[souda-aux-adjective-seems-like]] or [[garu-aux-verb-show-signs-of]].
