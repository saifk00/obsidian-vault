In 1915, Lenin wrote in thesis 11 of https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/oct/13.htm that if the imperialist powers would not accept peace terms that involved the independence of oppressed nations, the revolutionary government would have to wage revolutionary war - by calling to arms the peoples of such nations to fight against their government.

However, after the October revolution, he also published the Decree on Peace:
https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/oct/25-26/26b.htm which states that Russia was prepared to make concessions to agree to some sort of peace, so long as it mostly obeyed the spirit of the appeal.

These appear contradictory - I _think_ that the message of 1915 was his real belief, while the 1917 was meant for the people of Russia and other belligerent nations to read and think that Russia was indeed suing for peace under any terms. But reading [[russian-revolution-moslem-appeal]] makes it clear that even after accepting peace, the mission was to stir uprisings in oppressed nations to throw off the yoke of capital.

The above is incorrect - reading the beginning part of this https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1978/lenin3/ch04.html#f1 it is clear that Lenin genuinely changed his stance in the wake of stiff opposition from German leadership.
