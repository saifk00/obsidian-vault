One of the major early projects led by the [[osrd]] (back when it was still called NDRC) was the MIT Radiation Laboratory, commonly called the Rad Lab.

Its initial objective was to develop methods to better track and destroy German bombers in Britain.

It would become the model for many large [[cold-war-military-research-projects]] like SAGE, and the Atlas and Polaris missile systems [[turner-2006]].
