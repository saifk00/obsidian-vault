This note is a rough thought and should be refined further.

Here are some examples
- In "the Third Manifesto", the authors argue that the relational calculus is a *formal system*, and SQL should be redefined to more rigorously match that formalism because computers are fundamentally formal systems by nature (they are implemented using boolean logic).
- One of the reasons [[why-obsidian-is-useful]] is that the non-linear note-taking system reinforces connections across notes in the same way that the brain recalls information, by association rather than linearly
- One of the things Dr K says about dharma is that by following it, we reduce the *friction* between your action and reality; friction is created by the Ego and its own

In some metaphysical way, reducing friction between things is more harmonious and we should choose the path of less friction for things to be 'better'
