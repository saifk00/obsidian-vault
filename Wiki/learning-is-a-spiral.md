One mistake I often make after adopting Obsidian as a note taking system is to think I have truly understood everything I've noted down. I can't remember the source, but I remember reading something about the [[eightfold-path]] and how you can envision each spoke as points on a spiral that ascends upward to infinity. The adherent will frequently revisit each spoke as their knowledge grows, building it up slightly before moving on to the next. It's the same with a zettlekasten system, and in fact it is one of its greatest strengths.
