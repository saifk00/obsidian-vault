## Question
How is the layout problem formalized in the literature? What mathematical frameworks currently exist for analog layout? What is the current state of the art?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[The layout problem]] - Existing investigation of DARPA IDEA project and automated layout systems
- [[Variational Principles in Analog Layout Optimization]] - Connection to physics-based optimization
- Research needed: Academic literature survey, optimization frameworks

## Initial Investigation
From [[The layout problem]]:
- MAGIC (a DARPA IDEA (2018, $100M+ project)) demonstrated automated flow: netlist → constraint extraction → device generation → placement → routing → GDSII
- Current approaches use traditional optimization methods (simulated annealing historically)

## Further Questions
- What are the mathematical constraints specific to analog layout?
- How do current approaches handle the multi-objective optimization problem?
- Can machine learning approaches outperform traditional optimization?
- What role does manufacturing variability play in the formalization?
