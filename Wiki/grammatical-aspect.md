Where tense indicates the relation between the time of the referent to another time - usually the speech event (e.g. "the cow died" - the cow died prior to me saying this sentence), aspect describes how an action/state/event extends over time.

The easiest way to understand the difference is that tense describes temporally *when* something happened, while aspect describes temporally *how* it happened.
