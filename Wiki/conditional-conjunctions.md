ば: [[makino-2023]]@81
- $S_1$ ba $S_2$, if $S_1$ is the case, then $S_2$ 
なら: [[makino-2023]]@281
- Actually the simplified version of ならば (nara + ba particle), conditional form of [[japanese-copula]]
- Implies that the speaker *supposes* $S_1$ is true
	- It is ungrammatical to use when it doesn't make sense to suppose the truth of $S_1$, e.g. if it is always true, impossible to tell, or already known
