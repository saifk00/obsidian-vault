# Kant - Central Questions

## Core Metaphysical Questions

### Are the categories of understanding identical to the categories of reality?
According to [[kantian-metaphysics]], Kant claims that the categories of understanding *are* the categories of reality. This contradicts the idea that [[there-are-no-universal-categories]].

**Key tension:** How did Kant reach this conclusion? What justifies this strong metaphysical claim?

### How does transcendental idealism resolve the veil of perception problem?
The classical veil of perception problem imagines the subject on one side and the 'thing in itself' on the other, with sensory data bridging them. But this visualization presupposes the existence of space - the very thing in question!

**Kant's solution:** Distinguishes between "internal" and "external" perception:
- **Internal perception:** structured by temporality (thoughts appear in temporal order)
- **External perception:** structured by space (objects appear spatially extended)

*From [[transcendental idealism]]*

### What is the relationship between experience and scientific knowledge?
The idea of "theory as coming to consciousness" suggests that rigorous theories formalize unconscious aspects of our being:
- Humans see in perspective naturally, but perspective principles took time to formalize in art
- Humans reason under uncertainty, but probability theory emerged only in 1654

**Central question:** Are the categories of experience those of reality (as [[kantian-metaphysics]] suggests)? Is science merely axiomatizing experiential categories until we achieve perfect description of nature?

*From [[theory-as-coming-to-consciousness]]*

## Historical Context and Development

### How does Kant relate to his successors?
**Hegel's development:** According to [[hegelian-philosophy]], Hegel built on Kant while addressing limitations in the Kantian system.

**Marx's engagement:** Referenced in [[liedman-2018]], showing Kant's influence on later political and economic thought.

## Unresolved Tensions

1. **Universal vs. Particular:** How can Kant assert universal categories while acknowledging individual experiential differences?

2. **Thing-in-itself vs. Phenomena:** If we can never know the thing-in-itself, what ontological status does it have?

3. **Synthetic a priori knowledge:** How is knowledge that is both informative about the world and knowable independently of experience possible?

## Research Directions

- [ ] Investigate Kant's derivation of the categories in the Critique of Pure Reason
- [ ] Compare Kantian transcendental idealism with other idealisms
- [ ] Explore the relationship between Kantian metaphysics and contemporary cognitive science
- [ ] Examine how Hegel's critique of Kant addresses the thing-in-itself problem
