# Notes
See [[copula]] for a general discussion of copulas in linguistics. In Japanese, the copula だ has multiple forms
- だ: predicatively
	- In this form, the copula has the usual function of denoting the predicate of the sentence
	- Example: "私は学生だ"
	- Note that this form is 'semantically empty' unlike the english 'to be' which implies a state of existence
- な: attributively
	- In this form, the copula indicates that the subject is being described
	- Example: "静かな人"
- で: adverbially
	- This is the [[te-form]]
