# I-Maps
[[bayesian-networks]]

A graph $\mathcal{G}$ is an I-Map of a probability distribution $P$ if the independencies that it encodes is a subset of the independence relationships that hold in the distribution.

We often denote the set of independencies that a graph or distribution encodes as $\mathcal{I}$

A bayesian network may be the I-Map of many probability distributions, and a probability distribution may have multiple I-maps (which vary in what subset of independencies they encode).
