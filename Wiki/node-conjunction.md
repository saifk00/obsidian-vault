# ので
A [[conjunction]] indicating the reason or cause for something. The [[subordinate-clause]] comes first indicating the cause/reason, followed by the [[main-clause]] indicating the result.
## Forms
$S_1$ ので $S_2$
because $S_1$, $S_2$

`{V/Adj(i)} ので`: because s.t. {verb(ed), was (adj(i))}
`{Adj(na) stem / N} {な、だった} ので` : because s.t. is {noun-like}
## Examples
### あついので水おたくさん読んでね。
- "it is hot out, so drink a lot of water"
- Uses the `Adj(i) ので` form
- [ので](https://jlptsensei.com/learn-japanese-grammar/%e3%81%ae%e3%81%a7-node-meaning/#examples) here is used to indicate that あつい is the reason you should 水おたくさん読んでね
## 田中さんわまだ中学生なので、車お運転できない
- Because Tanaka-san is still a junior high student (中学生), he cannot drive a car
- Uses the `Nなので` form - note how this form requires the `な` sound after the na-Adjective or Noun
# Notes
- This is etymologically the [[te-form]] of [[no-da-phrase]]
- The main difference between ので and から in [[kara-conjunction-reason]] is that ので is used when the provided cause/reason is valid, evident, and acceptable to the hearer. ので *cannot* be used, for example, in the following situations:
	- $S_1$ is the speaker's conjecture (because I think $S_1$, $S_2$)
	- $S_2$ is something the speaker *wants/thinks* should happen because of $S_1$. e.g. if $S_2$ is a:
		- command
		- request
		- suggestion
		- invitation
- In contrast to [[de-particle-causal]], ので links [[clause]]s; i.e. the subordinate clause must be a sentence (not a noun as for `で`)
