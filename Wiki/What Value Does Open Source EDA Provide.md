## Question
What value does an open-source EDA provide? Beyond cost reduction, how does open-source development change the relationship between designers, tools, and semiconductor manufacturing?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[technology-as-fetish]] - How open tools might reveal rather than conceal labor relations
- [[hardware-compilers]] - Historical moment of transition in hardware compilation
- Need to research: Open-source hardware tool ecosystems, academic research enablement

## Initial Investigation
*[Research findings will be added here as investigation progresses]*

## Further Questions
- How does transparency in EDA tools change the power dynamics in semiconductor industry?
- What research becomes possible when EDA tools are modifiable?
- How do open-source tools handle intellectual property and trade secrets?
- What are the sustainability models for open-source EDA development?
