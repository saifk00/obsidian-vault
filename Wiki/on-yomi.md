On-yomi are the reading(s) derived from the chinese pronunciation. There were several waves of importation of these sounds which is why there are often many on-yomi for the same kanji.

The On-yomi reading is often used when a kanji appears as part of a *compound*.

On-yomi readings are often written in katakana.
