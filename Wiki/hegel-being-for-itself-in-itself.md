In seeking to understand the [[1844-economic-and-philosophic-manuscripts]] I realized marx often brings up the phrase 'for itself' and 'in itself'. According to the footnotes in the manuscripts, this has roots in [[hegelian-philosophy]].

> consciousness is, on the one hand, consciousness of the object, and on the other hand, it is conscious- ness of its own self. It is consciousness of what, to it, is the true, as well as consciousness of its knowing of the true.
> Sec 85; Phenomenology of Spirit

My understanding is still quite rudimentary and is based on the colloquial usage of these terms

For X to be 'in itself', the qualities of X are determined wholly within itself. For example, when X is a goal in itself is understood to be a goal which is determined as a goal wholly by its own properties - it doesn't need reference to something external to be qualified as a goal.

For X to be 'for Y', the qualities of X are determined by some mediation movement from X to Y. For example, if Y is consciousness and X is myself, I can be 'for myself' through the mediation movement of self-perception. That is, "I" experience "I" by being self aware, and this experience mediates my knowing of myself - it is not determined wholly by what I am in myself.

So, what I am 'in myself' is the explicit truth about myself, whereas what I am 'for myself' is something completely different, and conditioned by the consciousness I have of myself (self-perception).

Here's an actual quote from Hegels [history of philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hpintroa.htm):
> In order to comprehend what development is,-what may be called two different states must be distinguished. The first is what is known as capacity, power, what I call being-in-itself (_potentia_); the second principle is that of being-for-itself, actuality (_actus_). If we say, for example, that man is by nature rational, we would mean that he has reason only inherently or in embryo: in this sense, reason, understanding, imagination, will, are possessed from birth or even from the mother's womb. But while the child only has capacities or the actual possibility of reason, it is just the same as if he had no reason; reason does not yet exist in him since he cannot yet do anything rational, and has no rational consciousness. Thus what man is at first implicitly becomes explicit, and it is the same with reason. If, then, man has actuality on whatever side, he is actually rational; and now we come to reason.

'in itself' is a "potential" (visualize the potential residing within the entity)
'for itself' is "actuality" (visualize a thing standing for itself)
