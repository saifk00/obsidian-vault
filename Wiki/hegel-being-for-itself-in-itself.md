In seeking to understand the [[1844-economic-and-philosophic-manuscripts]] I realized marx often brings up the phrase 'for itself' and 'in itself'. According to the footnotes in the manuscripts, this has roots in [[hegelian-philosophy]].

> consciousness is, on the one hand, consciousness of the object, and on the other hand, it is conscious- ness of its own self. It is consciousness of what, to it, is the true, as well as consciousness of its knowing of the true.
> Sec 85; Phenomenology of Spirit

My understanding is still quite rudimentary and is based on the colloquial usage of these terms

For X to be 'in itself', the qualities of X are determined wholly within itself. For example, when X is a goal in itself is understood to be a goal which is determined as a goal wholly by its own properties - it doesn't need reference to something external to be qualified as a goal.

For X to be 'for Y', the qualities of X are determined by some mediation movement from X to Y. For example, if Y is consciousness and X is myself, I can be 'for myself' through the mediation movement of self-perception. That is, "I" experience "I" by being self aware, and this experience mediates my knowing of myself - it is not determined wholly by what I am in myself.

So, what I am 'in myself' is the explicit truth about myself, whereas what I am 'for myself' is something completely different, and conditioned by the consciousness I have of myself (self-perception).
