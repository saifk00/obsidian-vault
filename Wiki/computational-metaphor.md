One thing you will often hear from [[digital-utopians]] is computation as the central metaphor of reality: "The universe is a computer [...] thinking is a type of computation, DNA is software, evolution is an algorithmic process" (Kevin Kelly quoted in [[turner-2006]]@15)

Kevin Kelly also states: "Is this embrace just a trick of language? Yes, but *that* is the unseen revolution. We are compiling a vocabulary and a syntax that is able to describe in a single language all kinds of phenomenon [sic] that have escaped a common language until now. **it is a new universal metaphor**".

[[turner-2006]] sees it like this. On one hand, we have the children of the '60s countercultural movement - call this FSM. On the other hand, we have the [[digital-utopians]] exemplified by those like [[kevin-kelly]], [[esther-dyson]], and [[john-barlow]] of the EFF - call them DU. These two groups are shared in their acceptance of the computational metaphor, but differ in their evaluation of it in two key regards:

1. Disembodiment: The transformation of self into data
DU:
- Disembodiment frees us from prejudice and physical coercion, enabling free speech without the fear of reprisal(see Barlow's [[declaration-of-the-independence-of-cyberspace]]) 
FSM:
- Disembodiment is dehumanization. "you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels [...] you've got to make it stop" (Mario Savio quoted in [[turner-2006]])

2. Capitalism: the relation of technology to the economic structures of the day
DU:
- property is based on matter, and there is no matter here ([[declaration-of-the-independence-of-cyberspace]])
- Ubiquity of information will dissolve the inequality between individual and corporation, putting them on equal footing ([[esther-dyson]])
- The world of the soft will command the world of the hard ([[kevin-kelly]])
FSM:
- The structures of society are "a mechanism held together by rules and powered by money" (Kerr quoted in [[turner-2006]])
- Information as a commodity that fuels militarism
- The worker sinks to the level of a commodity - the IBM punch card
# Origins
The origins of the computational metaphor lie in the research world that started during WWII and became firmly established in the [[closed-world]] of the cold war: [[shift-towards-interdisciplinary-research-in-america]].
