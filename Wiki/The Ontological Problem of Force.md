# The Ontological Problem of Force

What justifies calling both contact forces (pushing) and action-at-a-distance (gravity) by the same name "force"?

> "IN elementary school we are taught that a 'force' is when you push an object. But then how is gravity a force? in fact, what is a force at all but a bookkeeping mechanism for how objects are moved?"

## Historical Context

> "During most of the 18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity remained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a mechanism — in particular, a contact mechanism — producing gravitational forces"

The absence of a **contact mechanism** for gravity was a major philosophical problem. If force means "push," then gravity appears to be something fundamentally different.

## The Categorical Problem

> "what right do we have to say that pushing an object is the same kind of thing as the way celestial bodies interact?"

This raises deeper questions:
- Are we justified in unifying different causal mechanisms under one concept?
- Is "force" just mathematical bookkeeping rather than describing unified physical reality?
- What if there are many different things that can cause acceleration, and pushing is just one of them?

## Research Questions

- What was Newton's philosophical methodology for establishing F = dp/dt?
- How did Newton justify treating contact and non-contact interactions as the same type of entity?

## Connection to Modern Physics

This ontological skepticism about force may be vindicated by modern field theories and general relativity, where "force" becomes curvature of spacetime - a geometric rather than mechanical concept.
