The section "The forgotten openness of the closed world" of [[turner-2006]] aims to answer the following question - what are the origins of the [[computational-metaphor]] that is so dominant today?

- [[vannevar-bush]] founded the [[osrd]] in 1940 with the approval of [[franklin-roosevelt]]
	- Its goal - fund civilian research with government money
		- Universities: MIT, Cal-tech, Harvard
		- Industry: GE, RCA, Du-Pont, Westinghouse
	- As a result, a huge and hierarchical beauracracy formed around managing all these resources and projects
	- [[mit-radlab]] becomes the model for the laboratories themselves - not hierarchical, but flush with cash and highly interdisciplinary
