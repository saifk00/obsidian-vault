There are many verbs used for giving and receiving in japanese; varying by viewpoint and politeness.

**もらう** [[makino-2023]]@261
- 僕は山本さんに本おもらった (I got a book from yamamoto)
	- **notice that に here indicates the source/agent**, you can use から too when there is no 'direct contact' implied (i.e. から is more like 'source' and に is 'agent')
- Used for the receiver's POV when the giver is of lower status
- The receiver may be someone the speaker empathizes with (in-group member), or the speaker themselves
- いただく is the humble equivalent of もらう
	- 私は先生に本おいただいた (I received a book from my sensei)
- Can be used as an auxiliary verb to imply that the receiver *benefitted* from an action described by the other verb
	- 私は父にカメラお買ってもらった
