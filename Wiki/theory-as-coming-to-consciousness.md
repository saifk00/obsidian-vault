This idea came from [[Franklin-2015]] in the context of probability theory. The idea is that many rigorous scientific/mathematical theories are in some sense a 'coming-to-consciousness' of certain unconscious facets of our being.

The example given is of visual perspective. Humans naturally see in perspective, but it took a long time for the principles of perspective could be precipitated and applied to the visual arts.

Humans reasoned under uncertainty long before the development of [[probability-theory]], and it took until 1654 for us to have a precise mathematical treatment (in some sense, this treatment is still being developed).

What are the implications of this? Are the categories of experience those of reality, as [[kantian-metaphysics]] would say? And science is just a matter of axiomatizing those categories until we have a perfect description of nature?
