だろう is the informal version of でしょう, which was originally the *conjecture* form of the [[japanese-copula]]. However, it is now used as an auxiliary - see example 1 where the copula appears twice - once to inflect for past tense and then once as the conjecture.

だろう can also be used with probability adverbs like [[tabun]] and [[kitto]] to modify the degree of sureness.

In questions, だろう can seek confirmation from the listener ("right?") - see example 2, or, with the question mark, softens the question (example 3).
