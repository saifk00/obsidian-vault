Vice president of MIT in 1932, founder of the company that became [[raytheon]].

In 1940, he convinced [[franklin-roosevelt]] to create the National Defence Research Committee, which would eventually become [[osrd]], to further coordination between military and civilian researchers. Interestingly, this is before the US even entered the war. 

# As We May Think

One can't help but think about the flood of information we are faced with in the modern internet, not to mention the landfills of "AI"-generated garbage that threatens to make utterly useless all the amassed information available on the web.

The problem, for Bush, is that
> The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record.

I.e. we need a faster way to *consume* information.

Interestingly, Bush has a materialist view of why the computer had not yet come into being:
> Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper

This recalls a point in Cockshott's [[towards-a-new-socialism]]:
> Historians have long argued that the reason why the ancients failed to develop an industrial society, despite all the science of the Greeks and the engineering skills of the Romans, was the institution of slavery. Where all industrial production was relegated to slaves, rational calculation of labour costs was discouraged. A slave was not paid by the hour, so the master had no incentive to account for the hours of his servants’ labour
> - Cockshott p.49

Part 1 of Bush's essay is preoccupied with the potential of the current moment. We have arrived at "an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it".

> The _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox

Wikipedia now fits on a thumb drive.

Bush describes a number of mechanisms that can make the *production* of observation and information much more efficient - dictation, shrinking schemes, etc.

He then turns his attention to the problem of *indexing* this information:

> Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome [...] The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.

This sounds exactly like the motivation for [[why-obsidian-is-useful]] - **operate by *association* not *indexes*.**

For Bush, the main benefit of mechanizing information retrieval over the vast and intricate system of human memory is that the record is *permanent*, while memory is *transitory*.

He recognizes the limitation of his work - it is only an extrapolation of existing technology. It is thus biased towards the outcomes of the same ideologies that produced the present moment.

He points out another reason why I find Obsidian such a great note taking tool:
> His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.

He believes that more knowledge can enlighten humanity despite the numerous cruelties it has enabled. But he does not seem so assured, he merely states that now "would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome".
