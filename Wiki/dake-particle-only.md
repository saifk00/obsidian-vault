**だけ**

Expresses a limit on something that might otherwise be growing. The english equivalent is 'only, just, merely', etc.
# Notes
- Can also be used with other particles to indicate a limit on them. For example, in example 1 the construction だけに translates to 'only to (me)'
- Can be used with the [[japanese-potential-verb-form]] to indicate 'as much as one can X', as in example 4
# Examples
1. 僕に**だけ**に話してください
2. あの先生には一度だけ会いました
3. この本は高いだけで面白くない
	- Note that で here is the te-form of the [[japanese-copula]]
	- Also note that we use the negative form of 面白い ([[i-adjectives]])
		- This construction can be used to say "something is just X, not Y"
4. 出来るだけゆっくり話してください
