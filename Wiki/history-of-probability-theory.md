To understand the [[philosophy-of-probability]] we must first examine its history, since [[the-history-of-a-subject-and-prevailing-ideology-are-intertwined]]. 

What did the term 'probability' mean prior to the development of the mathematical theory? It primarily applied to *opinions* and *actions* - those which could be considered 'reasonable' in given circumstances. It could also apply in a legal context: for propositions that had good evidence: given the fact that so-and-so had motive and opportunity, it is probable that they committed the crime.
