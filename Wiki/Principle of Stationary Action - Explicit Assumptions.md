# Principle of Stationary Action - Explicit Assumptions

The variational principle makes classical mechanics' hidden assumptions transparent:

> "the _principle_ of stationary action makes the assumptions underlying classical mechanics explicit"

## Three Core Assumptions

### 1. Motion is Smooth
Configuration paths are **continuous, differentiable functions**.

### 2. Motion is Anhysteretic
**Rewinding the clock is impossible** since the same state may have had many causes.

### 3. Motion is Deterministic
Given "enough" info on the current state, we can project forward in time to determine its eventual path.

## Quantum Mechanical Violations

> "(1) and (3) are plainly false at the quantum level. im not sure about (2)."

- **Smoothness fails:** Quantum paths can be non-differentiable, even discontinuous
- **Determinism fails:** Quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic
- **Anhysteretic nature unclear:** The relationship between quantum measurement and time-reversibility requires further investigation

## Research Directions

> "i should explore change of coordinate system matrices and how they might be applied to newtonian mechanics; this would elucidate why a variational principle is easier to work with when arbitrary coordinates are required"

The coordinate-independence of variational principles may be key to understanding their power over Newtonian formulations.

**TODO:** Investigate relationship between continuity and differentiability

## Philosophical Implications

By making these assumptions explicit, the variational principle reveals that classical mechanics is built on specific metaphysical commitments about the nature of physical reality - commitments that quantum mechanics forces us to abandon.
