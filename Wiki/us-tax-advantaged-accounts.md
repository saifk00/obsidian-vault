- 401k is sort of like an employer-offered RRSP
	- it has a relatively high contribution limit (~23k)
	- contributions are _deductible_
	- gains are _taxed on distribution_
	- the disadvantage is that its offered thru the employer, so your investment options are limited
- IRAs are 'individual retirement arrangements'
	- Traditional IRA is sort of like a managed RRSP; earnings are deducted and distributions are taxed
		- except there is a limit to deductions
			-  if your MAGI is over 87k and you are covered under a 401k, there's no deduction
	- Roth IRA is sort of like a TFSA; earnings are not deducted, but distributions are not taxed as a result (free cap gains)

Notice that if you cant deduct contributions to a traditional IRA, the only difference between trad and roth is that your roth gains _arent_ taxed
- A _backdoor_ is where you contribute to the trad and rollover to the roth to at least reap that benefit
