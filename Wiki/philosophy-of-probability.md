According to [[franklin-2015]] there are three levels of reasoning under uncertainty. In order of increasing consciousness and precision, but decreasing applicability, they are:
1. Unconscious inference - the natural reactions we have to uncertain situations
2. Ordinary language - e.g. 'beyond a reasonable doubt' in law
3. Formal - the logic of [[probability-theory]]

There are also two fundamental types of probability
1. [[stochastic-probability]]
2. [[epistemic-probability]]
A big question in the philosophy of probability is whether one of these is reducible to the other.

# Interpretations of Probability
Approaches to the philosophy of probability primarily center around how they interpret probability itself - that is, the value assigned to some event as 'the probability' of that event. The taxonomy here is due to [[hajek-2007]], who lays it out in the context of the [[reference-class-problem]] - a problem that plagues all these interpretations.
