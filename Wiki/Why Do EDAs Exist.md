## Question
What is the history of foundries, EDA companies, and their separation? Do these institutional arrangements encode a set of human relations similar to how compilers reorganize labor?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[technology-as-fetish]] - EDAs reorganize human labor relations, not just solve technical problems
- [[hardware-compilers]] - Historical context of hardware compilation evolution
- Need to research: EDA industry history, foundry business models, labor division

## Initial Investigation
*[Research findings will be added here as investigation progresses]*

## Further Questions
- What specific human relations do EDAs abstract away?
- How did the foundry-fabless-EDA triangle emerge historically?
- What would non-fetishized EDA tooling look like?
- When did the separation between design and manufacturing occur in semiconductors?
