Humans have imperfect memory
- We learn things through _repetition_ and _manipulation_
- Knuth alludes to this in his summary of [[literate-programming]]: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr3WTR0a5SM)
The act of capturing a thought has a tendency to drown out other thoughts
- I can think faster than I capture
- Capturing requires writing down the context of the detritus, but that takes much time and effort and many things can be forgotten in that time
Can an LLM help?
- I think they are useful in domains where answers are easily verifiable

I call random thoughts _detritus_
