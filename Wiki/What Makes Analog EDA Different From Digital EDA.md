## Question
What makes designing an analog EDA fundamentally different from tools like KiCAD or digital flows? What are the ontological domains specific to analog design?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[high-level-synthesis]] - Digital hardware compilation approaches
- [[CIRCT]] - Digital hardware compilation infrastructure
- Need to research: Analog design constraints, verification challenges, optimization objectives

## Initial Investigation
*[Research findings will be added here as investigation progresses]*

## Further Questions
- How do continuous vs. discrete domains affect design methodology?
- What role does physics simulation play in analog vs. digital verification?
- How do parasitic effects change the optimization landscape?
- Can digital compilation techniques be adapted for analog domains?
