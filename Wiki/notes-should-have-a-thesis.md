When constructing a personal knowledge management system, notes should have a thesis; that is, they should represent an 'atomic concept'. This allows us to transcend the boundaries of naive categorization (e.g. grouping notes by book, chapter, subject, etc.) because [[there-are-no-universal-categories]]. Think about it - are you more likely to need "notes on Capital Volume 1. Chapter 12," or are you going to be searching for "Marx quote about the length and weight of the worker's chain"?
