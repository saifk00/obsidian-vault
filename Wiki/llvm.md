# History
LLVM began in 2000 at UIUC as a research project under the direction of [[vikram-adve]] and [[chris-lattner]] (of [[si-five]]). Originally it was just supposed to be an infrastructure for researching compilation techniques - hence the acronym Low Level Virtual Machine.

In 2005, [[chris-lattner]] was hired by Apple to adapt LLVM for internal usage.

In 2006, [[clang]] was born as an LLVM frontend.

The 2012 ACM Software System was awarded to lattner and co. for developing LLVM. #conjecture this is around the time that LLVM became the core compiler infrastructure for the industry

#todo what industry trends made llvm *the* standard for compiler infra?
