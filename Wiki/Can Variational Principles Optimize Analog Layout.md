## Question
Can variational principles (like those explored in physics) be applied to create smooth, differentiable objective functions for analog layout optimization?

## Relevant Sources and Notes
- [[Principle of Stationary Action - Explicit Assumptions]] - Variational principles in physics
- [[The layout problem]] - Current optimization approaches in layout
- Connection to physics-based optimization methods

## Initial Investigation
*[Research findings will be added here as investigation progresses]*

## Further Questions
- What would be the analog layout equivalent of "action" in physics?
- How can physical constraints be formulated as variational problems?
- Could this enable gradient-based optimization of layout problems?
- What role would manufacturing process variations play in such formulations?
