# Technology and Fetishism Overview

## Core Idea
Technologies are not only solutions to technical problems, they are also solutions to *human* problems. A compiler, for example, does not merely translate code into machine instructions; it reorganizes human labor. Instead of thousands of companies each hiring machine-level programmers, a small group of compiler engineers can serve them all. In this way, the compiler acts as an interface between sets of humans, abstracting and concealing relations of labor and expertise.  

This resonates with Marx’s concept of **commodity fetishism**, where social relations among people are inverted into relations among things. The interface of technology often hides and reshapes human relations, making them appear as properties of the tool itself rather than of the social structures behind it.

## Relevance
Understanding technology through this lens allows us to see:
- How **abstraction layers** (compilers, databases, operating systems, LLMs) not only solve technical challenges but also redistribute and conceal social relations.
- How fetishism is not just about commodities, but also about *technologies* that appear autonomous while hiding collective human work.
- How these mediating artifacts redefine what counts as “human work” at all, raising humans to higher levels of abstraction while centralizing technical implementation.
