This is part of a series of notes in which I explore the history of computer hardware, with a focus on graphics/acceleration stacks. We start at the 'beginning' - the birth of the Personal Computer

- IC -> MOS -> 4004 in 1971, the first single-chip microprocessor (DIP package)
- 1945 [[vannevar-bush]] publishes As We May Think
- 1946
	- Feb 15 [[ENIAC]] is switched on
- 1968 [[mother-of-all-demos]]
	- still used a mainframe; required multiple technicians to operate. But still laid out what would become the user experience of personal computing (?)
- 1973 - [[xerox-alto]] similar to the NLS demoed in [[mother-of-all-demos]]
