# Newtonian Mechanics as Differential Equations

The reformulation F = dp/dt where p(t) = mv is more mathematically elegant than F = ma when working with systems where mass varies with time.

> "if we want to conceptualize this as describing a differential equation on a configuration path (system variables as a function of time), it becomes super useful to rewrite this as F = dp/dt where p(t) = mv. that lets mass and velocity vary as a function of time, and helps as avoid carrying the m everywhere"

This reformulation treats physics as differential equations on **configuration spaces** - system variables as functions of time. The configuration path becomes the fundamental object of study rather than individual forces and accelerations.

## Mathematical Advantages

- Allows mass to vary with time naturally
- Cleaner notation when working with complex systems
- More direct connection to variational principles
- Better suited for coordinate transformations

## Visualization Potential

This mathematical reformulation could be demonstrated in the unified physics app, showing how the same physical system can be represented with different mathematical frameworks.
