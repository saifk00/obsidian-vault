Inflection is when a word is modified to express some grammatical category, such as
- tense
- case
- [[grammatical-aspect]]
- person
- number
- gender
- mood
- [[animacy]]
- [[definiteness]]

The inflection of verbs is called [[conjugation]], while the inflection of everything else (nouns, adjectives, etc.) is called [[declension]].
