The categories of normal experience are dictated by our social being - the temptation to write sequential notes is a byproduct of the very specific historical circumstance that schools work in the way they do. There is nothing eternal about it. Not that categories aren't useful - it's just that it is worth re-examining the 'default categories' you might assume and remember you are always free to create your own (a kind of pragmatic metaphysics)
