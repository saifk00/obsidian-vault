A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound which can distinguish one word from another in a given language.

English, for example, has 26 letters, but 44 phonemes. The letter `n` actually corresponds to two phonemes: `/n/` and `/ŋ/` - the `n` in "sin" uses `/n/` while the `n` in "sing" is `/ŋ/`.

Some sounds *dont* distinguish one word from another. For example the [[aspiration|aspirated]] vs. unaspirated `p`. See [[phone|phones]] for details.
