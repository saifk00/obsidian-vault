# Physics Visualization App Project

## Project Goal

> "I should synthesize my Metal Demo project with the Computation Geometry Visualizer library to create a single SwiftUI app that lets you select different visualizations of physics/math things I learned"

Unify existing visualization projects into a cohesive learning and demonstration platform.

## Technical Components

- **Metal Demo project:** GPU-accelerated rendering capabilities
- **Computation Geometry Visualizer library:** Mathematical visualization tools
- **SwiftUI:** User interface for selecting different demonstrations

## Potential Visualizations

Based on current studies:

### Mathematical Representations
- **Newtonian Formulations:** Comparison of F = ma vs F = dp/dt
- **Coordinate Systems:** Same physical system in different coordinate frames
- **Variational Principles:** Lagrangian vs Newtonian approaches to the same problem

### Physics Concepts
- **Force Ontology:** Demonstrating contact vs action-at-a-distance forces
- **Configuration Spaces:** Visualizing system states as paths through parameter space
- **Constraint Systems:** Rigid vs soft body behavior

### Classical Mechanics Assumptions
- **Smooth Motion:** Continuous vs discontinuous trajectories
- **Deterministic Paths:** Single vs probabilistic outcomes
- **Time Reversibility:** Forward vs backward time evolution

### Simulation Techniques
- **Rigid Bodies:** Global distance constraints, 6 degrees of freedom
- **Soft Bodies:** Local distance constraints, 3N degrees of freedom
- **Constraint Relaxation:** Transition between rigid and deformable behavior

## Architecture Considerations

- Modular visualization components
- GPU compute shaders for physics simulation
- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Educational annotations and explanations
