# Principles
- **Example Models**: We are primarily interested in models that are in some sense 'time-sensitive'. The goal here is to *accelerate* inference. For example, things like medical diagnosis, while important, are probably not as time sensitive as speech signal processing. It is already widely accepted that medical diagnosis can take a few weeks.
	- Good candidates
		- Anything with real-time data
			- Speech recognition
			- Live medical diagnostics (emergency alerts for people in ER)
		- Anything with massive amounts of data
