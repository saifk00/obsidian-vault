# MicroAlchemy - EDA Development Questions

## Project Overview

MicroAlchemy represents a two-pronged attack on the analog IC industry:
1. A maskless, large-process node lithography machine (3D printer for analog ICs)
2. An open-source design-to-layout EDA tool (LLVM for semiconductors)

The EDA component aims to create a **platform for testing ideas** rather than another monolithic tool - enabling modular, plug-and-play experimentation with layout algorithms.

## Core Investigation Questions

### Historical and Structural Analysis
- [[Why Do EDAs Exist]]
- [[How Do Cadence and Synopsys Maintain A Duopoly]]

### Technical and Ontological Foundations
- [[What Makes Analog EDA Different From Digital EDA]]
- [[How Is The Layout Problem Formalized]]
- [[Did Chisel Explore Analog Design]]

### Strategic and Implementation
- [[What Value Does Open Source EDA Provide]]
- [[Can Variational Principles Optimize Analog Layout]]

### Future Explorations
- [[Analog Layout Constraints Across Process Nodes]]
- [[Manufacturing Variability in Layout Optimization]]
- [[ML Integration in Modular Layout Frameworks]]
- [[Verification Approaches for Open Source Analog Tools]]
