# Loose Notes
- The social organizations necessitated by [[cold-war-military-research-projects]] led to the development of a whole system of symbols and language ([[cybernetics]]) that became the basis for technological developments in the '50s [[turner-2006]]. This is sort of like what we are seeing now with the language of AI and metaverses. Another key point in [[turner-2006]] is [[legitimacy-exchange]] - we are definitely seeing this with this new iteration of tech utopianism.
- [[norbert-wiener]] alerted [[vannevar-bush]] to the military applications of his theory that would become [[cybernetics]], and the latter had him assigned to work under the [[osrd]]'s gun control section. (https://www.jstor.org/stable/285691)
