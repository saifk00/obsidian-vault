In the winter of 2020 I took up astrophotography. I was taking [PHYS 275: Planets](https://uwflow.com/course/phys275) which served as my motivation for learning more about our place in the solar system and the universe at large. Since I also have an interest in the technology of optics and photography, I decided my goal would be to get a good picture of a DSO using my Nikon D7100 DSLR, and found out that the Orion Nebula was a good candidate. This was also around the time of the [Great Conjunction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Great_conjunction#/2020) so I got to view that too. Below is a set of three images, taken a few months apart, that I took of the Orion Nebula.

And below is the very first image I took; I had no idea what I was doing and mistook the shake in the camera for the rings of Saturn (not for long). On the top left is Saturn and the bottom right is Jupiter.

Overall I learned a lot more than I thought I would. There's quite a few resources online that I found useful, and I learned a lot about the basics of image processing and how to use the DSLR to get the best results. Just a list of some of the things I used:

- [DeepSkyStacker](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html)
- [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com/)
- **The Astrophotography Manual** by Chris Woodhouse (2017)
- Photoshop CS6 (has some handy pre-processing tools e.g. lens calibration)
- The Camera Manual (it was very well written)

I could go on and on about the things I learned, and some day I might, but for now here's some more pictures.

# Mars and M81

Mars (top middle) and a Galaxy (M81 I think). Took a lot of post-processing for this one hence the pink area on the bottom and vignetting on the top left.

# Pleiades
![[Pasted image 20231117184941.png]]
The Pleiades cluster. I hope to one day get a better shot of this, but I need better equipment first (planning on a mount like the Star Adventure Pro)

# Aldebaraan

The bright one there is Aldebaraan.
# The Setup
![[Pasted image 20231117185028.png]]
My camera (Nikon D7100) hooked into an Explore FirstLight 127mm Mak-Cas telescope. Too unstable for DSOs.
