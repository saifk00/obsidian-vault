# Preface
- pascal/fermat discov. math theory in 1654
- people dealt with uncertainty before 1654; how?
	- law, science, commerce, philosophy, logic - all have ways of dealing with uncertainty prior to the mathematical treatment
	- three levels of reasoning - unconscious, linguistic (non-numerical), formal
		- increasing precision, decreasing applicability
- two types of prob: {factual,stochastic,aleatory} probability, and {logical,epistemic} prob
	- factual: the outcome of some setup is really random
	- epistemic: something really happened, but our knowledge about it (and related propositions) are fundamentally uncertain
	- big question: is one of these reducible to the other?
